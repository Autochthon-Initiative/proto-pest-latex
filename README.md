# LaTeX Formula Parsing Using PEST - A Prototype

_Goal 1_: Be able to parse `EXAMPLE_FORMULA_2`.

See the [Grammar](src/latex-formula-grammar.pest) for implementation.

### Materials

It seems that as of right now (2020-10-07 16:01 CET) the [PEST website is down](https://github.com/pest-parser/pest/issues/477),
but they are working on it. A backup version can be found [here](https://bitbegin.github.io/pest-rs/).

Additionally, a WIP [book](https://bitbegin.github.io/pest-rs/book/intro.html)
is available for reference. Especially useful is [Chapter 3.2](https://bitbegin.github.io/pest-rs/book/grammars/syntax.html),
which describes the syntax of the `.pest` grammar files.
